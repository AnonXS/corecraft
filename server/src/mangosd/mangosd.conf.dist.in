#
#    DataDir
#        Data directory setting.

#                    hostname;port;username;password;database

#                        Named pipes: mySQL required adding "enable-named-pipe" to [mysqld] section my.ini
#                    .;/path/to/unix_socket;username;password;database - use Unix sockets at Unix/Linux
#                ---PGSQL---
#                    hostname;port;username;password;database
#                    .;/path/to/unix_socket/DIRECTORY or . for default path;username;password;database - use Unix sockets at Unix/Linux
#
#	LoginDatabaseConnections
#	WorldDatabaseConnections
#	CharacterDatabaseConnections
#		 Amount of connections to database which will be used for SELECT queries. Maximum 16 connections per database.
#		 Please, note, for data consistency only one connection for each database is used for transactions and async SELECTs.
#		 So formula to find out how many connections will be established: X = ¹_connections + 1
#		 Default: 1 connection for SELECT statements
#
#    MaxPingTime
#        Settings for maximum database-ping interval (minutes between pings)
#
#    WorldServerPort
#        Port on which the server will listen
#
#    BindIP
#        Bind World Server to IP/hostname
#        This option is useful for running multiple worldd/realmd instances
#        on different IP addresses using default ports.
#        DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU _REALLY_ KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING

# CONCURRENCY
#
#    Concurrency.NetworkThreads
#         Number of threads used for networking.
#
#    Concurrency.MapThreadsNum
#        Number of threads used to process maps. This number is recommended to be at leastone more than the amount

#    Concurrency.UsePathgenThread (Boolean)
#        Use a different thread for path generation that uses the detour library. Most paths are done in-place as they

#        to process them in a seperate thread.

# LOGGING
#
# = Overview =
# Below is a list of the various loggers. All loggers are user-defined in the
# code, except for "root" which is the logger output goes to if the code
# component uses no specific logger.
#
# = Hierarchical Logging =
# All loggers are children of "root", yet this is not reflected in the
# hierarchy. A new hierarchy is specified by a dot. For example, to create a
# parent "player" and two children "items" and "auras", the log hierarchy names
# would be:
#
# player
# player.items
# player.auras
#
# Hierarchies are multi-level. For example:
#
# player.items.gear
#
# = Log Levels =
# Each logger can have an assigned level. Any output to said logger that is
# below the assigned level is silently ignored. Except for Log Level 0, which
# means inherit level from parent. The available log levels are:
#
# 0: Parent
# 1: Debug (not available when building with -DENABLE_OPTIMIZED=1)
# 2: Info
# 3: Warning
# 4: Error
# 5: Critical
# 6: Ignored (output is filtered completely and will not appear)
#
# = Technical Notes =
# All output goes to stdout. Even if the output is error or above.
# See src/framework/logging.h for how to use the logger in code.
