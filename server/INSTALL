  Clone source code into src/

    git clone <repo> src

  With GCC:
    
    cmake ../src
    make install

  With Clang:

    Using libc++:

        cmake ../src
        make install

    Using libstdc++:

        cmake -DCLANG_CXXLIB="stdc++"
        make install

    Using Clang with a custom C++ ABI:

      If you find yourself on a system with no C++14 library, or compiler, you
      might be forced to build Clang, its library and a compatible C++ ABI
      yourself. To do so, please consult llvm.org. In this section we assume you
      have done the following steps:

        a) Build llvm and clang with gcc and install into
           /home/<user>/local/bin.

        b) Build libc++abi and install it into /home/<user>/local/lib.

        c) Build libc++ with -DLIBCXX_CXX_ABI=libcxxabi, install into
           /home/<user>/local/ (into ./include and ./lib).

        d) (Optional) rebuild llvm and clang with your newly installed clang
           setup.

        e) Build boost with your new setup, like this:

           # NOTE: You could also define your own toolset which points to your
           #       compiler
           # make boost look for clang in our user's local bin dir
           PATH="/home/<user>/local/bin:$PATH"
           
           # build boost with our clang, linking against our ABI
           ./b2 toolset=clang --prefix=/home/<user>/local \
           cxxflags="-std=c++14 -stdlib=libc++ -I/home/<user>/local/include" \
           linkflags="-stdlib=libc++ -L/home/<user>/local/lib -lc++abi"
       
       With the above listed setup, you would compile the core like this:

         cmake -DCLANG_CXXABI="c++abi" \
               -DCLANG_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/<user>/local/include \
               -DCLANG_LIB_DIR=/home/<user>/local/lib \
               -DCLANG_RPATH=/home/<user>/local/lib \
               ../src
         make install
