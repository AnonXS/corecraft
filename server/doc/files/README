These documentations have been written from an observer's point of view, and a
lot of things are still fuzzy for me. For that reason you should take the
documentation with a grain of salt, and whenever you find an error, correct it
and commit the result.

By no means is the documentation complete or fully correct, so keep that in mind
if you're new to the file formats!
