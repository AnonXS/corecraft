## Terms
Bounds: The distance away from target that respsects both target's and
    attacker's bounding radius.

# CHASE

## Statements
Stucture:
* [if (cond) ]State/Action --> Outcome

* if (Relax or Nullstate) Target out of range --> Enter "Chase" mode
* if (Chase) Target in bounds & Stationary --> Stop & Enter "Relax" mode
* if (Chase) Target OOR & stationary --> Run to bounds
* if (Chase) Target moving except backing --> Predict where he's headed, and run
             towards pos
* if (Chase) Target backing --> Run to bounds (this is probably done so it'll
             be easier for tanks to align NPCs and reposition them)
* if (Chase) Target moving & us moving -->
* if (Chase) Target deep in bounds & moving --> Go into "Pause" mode (since
             we're predictively moving we could end up running well in front
             otherwise)
* if (Chase) Target moved a lot from our dest pos --> Get new dest pos
* if (Pause) Target not in bounds --> Enter "Chase" mode
* if (Relax) Target gets deep into bounding box -> Enter "Back" mode & Start
             Timer
* if (Back) Timer Expired -> Move back
* if (Back) Target moved OOR -> Enter "Chase" mode
* if (Back) Timer Expired & Did move & Not moving --> Enter "Relax" mode
* if (Relax & Relax Timer Expired) Other friendly NPC attacking target is deep
              into my bounds & we're
             both stationary --> Enter "Spread" mode (see NOTE)
* if (Spread) If I'm stationary & no stationary NPC is well into my bounds ->
              Enter "Relax" mode
* if (Spread) If I'm stationary & another stationary NPC is well into my bounds
              & Our bounds isn't siginficantly bigger than his (big NPCs don't
              spread out for small-fry)
              --> Move to the right/left of said NPC

NOTE: Something prevents them continously spreading when someone else walks into
them. One part to it seems to be that they ignore NPCs currently in spread mode,
but it also seems to be something else, like a maximum amount of NPCs that can
spread every N seconds (or a random timer for each NPC involved), because they
don't all spread at the same time, there's a few NPCs that reposition at a time.

# FOLLOW

## Statements
Stucture:
* [if (cond) ]State/Action --> Outcome

* if (Relax) Target out of range --> Enter "Follow" mode
* if (Follow or Nullstate) Target in range & stationary --> Enter "Relax" mode
* if (Follow) Target moving --> Keep running towards follow pos, the NPC
             never really stops, but he seems to slow down a bit if he hits the
             location and is faster than his target.
* if (Follow) Target moved a lot from our dest pos --> Get new dest pos

NOTE: He seems to adjust his speed so he won't run ahead of his master. If the
master is in walk mode, so is he (but only if close to follow pos). This
suggests he somehow scales his speed to match the master if quicker than master.

TODO: Try writing this like a finite state machine?
