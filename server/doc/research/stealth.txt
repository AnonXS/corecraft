1. Facts about stealth
- One level is equal to 5 stealth points (source: Nightscape Boots).
- On retail (5.4) stealth ranges (with no modifier except for stealth):
NOTE: All of these distances are derived by memory reading, and are
      point-to-point, i.e. no bounding radius included.
  Same level: 4.5 yards detection (tried with level 5 and level 90).
  Stealther 1 level above: 3 yards detection (tried with level 4 and 5).
  Stealther 2,3,4,5 levels above: 1.5 yards detection (tried with level 85 and
      90, and then level 1,2,3 and level 5).
  Stealther 5 levels below: 16.5 yards detection (tried with level 85 and 90).
  Stealther 10 levels below: 19.5 yards detection (tried with level 80 and 90).
  Stealther 15 levels below: 27 yards detection (tried with level 5 and 20).
  Stealther 65 levels below: 30 yards detection (tried with level 5 and 70).
  Stealther 85 levels below: 30 yards detection (tried with level 5 and 90).
Shadowmeld range on retail is 9 yards for equal level targets (trid with level
    60 and 60).
  If someone is behind you (180 degrees arc) they cannot be detected (source:
      retail)
  If you're within 1.5 yards you can see the target NO MATTER WHAT, even if
  he's behind you.
  
2. Derivations
NOTE: These derivations apply for PLAYER stealth, mobs have stealths that are
more powerful.
- Dist < 1.5 ? Always visible. Dist > 30 ? Never visible.
- let a be the stealthed rogue's level, and b the level of the player looking at
  him, then the detection range for the rogue to be seen by the other guy is:
  dist = 4.5 + (b - a) * (1.5/5) ; limited to range [1.5,30]

3. Notes about expansion
In 5.4 (which the data and derivations is based on) there is no Master of
Deception. We know that MoD rank 5 increases your stealth level by 3 (the aura
gives +15 stealth points). If we assume that when MoD was removed the formula
was brought down 3 levels to compensate for that (which seems a possible route),
then the 4.5 yards for equal level would've been 9 yards.

If we assume that is true, then the formula for detection would be (ignoring
modifiers besides level):

dist = 9 + (b - a) * (1.5/5) ; limited to range [1.5,30]

Where a is the level of the rogue and b of the on-looker.

This is backed up by the shadowmeld range on retail, see point 1. We think this
means that rogues got the rank 5 MoD effect by default.

4. Stealth points and detection points
A player has stealth points and detection points. The detection points explain
how potent the player is in detecting stealth. The stealth points explain how
potent the player's current stealth is. Their base formulas are:

stealth points = 0
detection points = level * 5

SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH (16)
This aura define your base stealth points. Without this aura type your stealth
points are always 0, no matter if you have a SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH_LEVEL or
not.

SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH_LEVEL (154)
This aura type adds a flat modifier to your stealth points.

SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH_DETECT (17) WARNING: Only applies if misc == 0,
                                            (1 == trap detection)
This aura adds a flat modifier to your detection points.

Some interesting SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH and their stealth points:
Stealth rank 1 (level 1 spell): 5 + level * 5
Stealth rank 2 (level 20 spell): 100 + level * 5
Stealth rank 3 (level 40 spell): 200 + level * 5
Stealth rank 4 (level 60 spell): 300 + level * 5
Prowl rank 1 (level 20 spell): 100 + level * 5
Prowl rank 2 (level 20 spell): 200 + level * 5
Prowl rank 3 (level 20 spell): 300 + level * 5
Shadowmeld (level 0 spell): 0 + level * 5

5. Conclusion and resulting formula
If we ignore the constant of the stealth spells for a moment, the formula
becomes:

Let s be stealth points, d detection points, and y the detection distance in
yards then y is defined as:

y = 9 + (d - s) * (1.5/5)

Where y is in the range: [1.5,30].

If we introduce the constant of the stealth spell, however, the formula becomes
ill-formed. Ergo, one of the possibilites must be the case:

1) The stealth value constant is irrelevant and all SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH have
   the same strength.
2) The constant is expected to be transformed somehow. For example, 100 might
   indicate 10.0, and so on. This would not be the first time a base point is
   offset by an order of magnitude to achieve precision in an integer number.
   SPELL_EFFECT_ENERGIZE does this for example, where the actual gained
   mana/rage/etc is base_points/10.

Given that shadowmeld is 9 yards on retail, it would seem that at least
currently that offset is ignored. This doesn't mean it actually should be, but
for now we will assume that, since with that value the formula becomes
ill-formed.

6. What remains to be done
The most important thing from here on is figuring out the update timer of
stealth, which was harder than it sounds (the result is very inconsistent).
We tried by writing an addon that listens to the PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED event.
Using that addon one of us turned towards the stealthed target and spam tabbed,
as soon as he got target on the player, he turned away again. We reasoned that
this should reveal the update timer quite consistently, and in a normalized
fashion. We were wrong. We then reasoned that maybe the timer is seconds
precision such as:
next_dection = time(0) + 4;
But we remain unconvinced about that, and leave the research for the future.

Another thing is determing the purpose of the flat offset on stealth auras.
Our current theory is that they're a left-over from some early stage of the
game. For example, maybe using a level 60 stealth would always consider you
level 60, a level 40 stealth always level 40, and so on. In other words, maybe
there was no per level points. This should be determinable by looking at early
DBC data (such as the WoW alpha).
