The style/coding guidelines can be found in "GUIDELINES".

When committing new code or bug changes, make sure you follow the
following process.

1) Make sure your code follows the rules in "GUIDELINES".
2) Assert that the code compiles without warnings. Both in the latest
   gcc and clang.
3) Run clang-format.
   Point your terminal to the top-level source directory. And type:
   git diff -U0 HEAD^ | clang-format-diff.py -i -p1 -style=file
4) Run contrib/sort_includes.py
   Point your terminal to the top-level source directory. And type:
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=MA | python3 contrib/sort_includes.py
5) Write a commit message with a short summary (<72 characters), and
   a following description for the problem and the solution. Patches
   should be written in present tense. The summary should include a
   short note on which part of the system it modifies.
   An example commit message:
